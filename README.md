The `isotopes.csv` file contains the all the data used within the 

Number of variables: XX
Number of observations: XX
Variable description list:
* `Shark_ID`: contains the unique naming code for each whale shark observed at Ningaloo Reef between 2016 and 2022. Unique naming code are YYYY_WSXX where YYYY = Year of observation, WS = whale shark, XX is the observed whale shark that year.
* `host_d15n`: are the $\delta^{15}N$ values obtained from whale shark dermal tissues.
* `host_d13c`: are the $\delta^{13}C$ values obtained from whale shark dermal tissues.
* `host_n_percent`: are the nitrogen (N)% values present within whale shark dermal tissues.
* `host_c_percent`: are the carbon (C)% values present within whale shark dermal tissues.
* `host_cn_ratio`: contains the C:N ratio obtained from whale shark dermal tissues.
* `Year`: contains the year of sampling.
* `para_d15n`: are the $\delta^{15}N$ values obtained from untreated *P. rhincodonicus* tissues.
* `para_d13c`: are the $\delta^{13}C$ values obtained from untreated *P. rhincodonicus* tissues.
